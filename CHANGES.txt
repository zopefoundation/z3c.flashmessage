1.3 (unreleased)
================

- ``SessionMessageSource`` implicitly created sessions when the client was
  reading the messages from the source. Changed internal API so reading no
  longer creates a session when it not yet exists.

1.2 (2010-10-19)
================

* Removed test dependency on `zope.app.zcmlfiles`.


1.1 (2010-10-02)
================

* Removed test dependency on `zope.app.testing`.


1.0 (2007-12-06)
================

* Updated dependency to `zope.session` instead of `zope.app.session` to get
  rid of deprecation warnings.


1.0b2 (2007-09-12)
==================

* Bugfix: When there was more than one message in a source not all messages
  would be returned by the receiver.

1.0b1 (2007-08-22)
==================

* Initial public release.
